#summary Alternate installation for MythTV
= Introduction =

Below are alternate directions for using CoreAVC with MythTV.  This method involves direly loading the directshow code into MythTV.  It is a little faster than the server implementation (maybe a few percent) but cannot be used with x86_64 (only works with ia32), and is not as well supported as the server mechanism.  You can expect more frequent crashes using these instructions since the directshow code tends to crash when exiting/restarting.  I am not sure there is anything that can be done about it.  *I strongly recommend using the [MythTVInstallation server method] rather than these instaructions!*


= Details =

1) Download the code from svn:
{{{
svn checkout http://coreavc-for-linux.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ coreavc-for-linux 
cd coreavc-for-linux
}}}

2) Build mythtv patch:
{{{
./mythtv/build_dsl_patch.pl > mythtv/libdshowloader.patch
}}}

3) Install patch into MythTV:
{{{
cd <path to mythsrc>
patch -p0 < <path to coreavc-for-linux>/mythtv/libdshowloader.patch
make
make install
}}}
4) Install CoreAVC to /usr/lib/win32/CoreAVCDecoder.ax

5) Install CoreAVC license info as documented in [RegisterCoreAVC]
